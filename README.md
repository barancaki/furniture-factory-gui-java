## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# 🪑 Furniture Factory GUI (Java Swing)

A GUI-based furniture production application developed using key creational design patterns in Java.  
This project was created for the BYM 304 – Software Architecture and Design course (Spring 2025).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the following **design patterns**:

- 🔁 **Abstract Factory**: To generate families of related furniture objects (Chair, Sofa, CoffeeTable) for different styles (Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco).
- 🧬 **Prototype**: To clone furniture items dynamically at runtime.
- 🔒 **Singleton**: To manage application-wide access through a single instance (`AppManager`).

The application also adheres to **SOLID principles** and is developed using **Java Swing** for the graphical interface.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Select from 3 furniture styles: `Modern`, `Victorian`, `ArtDeco`
- Visual representation of each furniture item using images
- Clone furniture items using Prototype pattern
- Interactive GUI built with Java Swing
- Modular and extensible architecture
